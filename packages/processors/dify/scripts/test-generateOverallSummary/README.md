# Test Generate Overall Summary

A test script that uses the Dify API to generate an overall summary from multiple file summaries. This script verifies the functionality of the API that combines individual file summaries into a comprehensive PR overview.

## Test Data

The script uses the following test data to call the API:

- Title: "Test Overall Summary"
- Description: "Testing overall summary generation"
- Test Files:
  - Path: "test/file1.ts", "test/file2.ts"
  - Sample patch content for each file
- Test Summarize Results:
  - Summaries for each file
  - Review requirements and reasons

## Environment Setup

This script requires Dify API environment variables. For setup instructions, refer to the [project's main README](../../../../../README.md) in the "Test with DifyProcessor" section.

## Running the Script

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --env-file=.act.env --env-file=.act.secrets packages/processors/dify/scripts/test-generateOverallSummary/mod.ts
```

### Required Permissions

- `--allow-net`: For HTTP requests to the Dify API
- `--allow-env`: For accessing environment variables
- `--env-file`: For loading environment variable files

## Results

The script outputs the following information:

1. File Upload Status: Confirmation of test files and summary data uploads
2. Raw Response: Raw HTTP response data from the Dify API
3. Validated Response: Processed and validated overall summary data
